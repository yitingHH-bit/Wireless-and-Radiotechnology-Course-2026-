Wireless Communication Assignment Report
1. Method

In this assignment, the performance of WiFi, Bluetooth, and Cellular communication systems was analyzed as a function of distance.

The received power was calculated using the Friis transmission equation:

Pr = Pt * Gt * Gr * (lambda / (4 * pi * R))^2

Where:
Pr = received power (W)
Pt = transmit power (W)
Gt = transmitter antenna gain
Gr = receiver antenna gain
lambda = wavelength (m)
R = distance (m)

The wavelength was calculated as:

lambda = c / f

Where:
c = speed of light (3 x 10^8 m/s)
f = carrier frequency (Hz)

The Signal-to-Noise Ratio (SINR) was calculated as:

SINR = Pr / Pn

Where:
Pn = noise power (W)

The channel capacity was calculated using Shannon capacity formula:

C = BW * log2(1 + SINR)

Where:
C = channel capacity (bps)
BW = bandwidth (Hz)

For plotting, received power and SINR were converted to dB using:

X_dB = 10 * log10(X)

Capacity was also plotted in dB form as:

C_dB = 10 * log10(C)

2. Observations

For all technologies, received power decreases rapidly as distance increases. This is because Pr is proportional to 1 / R^2 according to the Friis equation.

Cellular communication maintains higher received power over long distances because it has higher transmit power (40 W) and lower frequency (850 MHz), which means a larger wavelength.

WiFi has the largest bandwidth (22 MHz), so at short distances it provides higher channel capacity.

Bluetooth operates at low power and short distance, so both SINR and capacity decrease quickly with distance.

Bandwidth mainly determines the maximum achievable data rate, while transmit power and frequency influence coverage distance.

3. Conclusion

WiFi is suitable for short-range high-data-rate communication.

Bluetooth is suitable for short-range, low-power applications.

Cellular systems support longer distances due to higher transmit power and lower frequency, but the bandwidth is smaller, which limits the maximum data rate compared to WiFi at short range.
